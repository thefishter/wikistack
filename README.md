Wikipedia clone: learning fullstack web development through leveraging Node, Express, Postgres, Sequelize

This workshop's focus will be on learning and utilizing the powerful Sequelize ORM in order to build an application that leverages a Postgres database for information storage and retrieval. An Object-relational Mapper models (represents) your data as objects, with properties and methods. This added functionality facilitates data manipulation in your JavaScript application; you don't need to set up complicated queries or do as much manual validation. Put another way, Sequelize is a JavaScript library which abstracts & simplifies the task of reading and writing to your SQL databases.

In this workshop, we will create a Wikipedia clone, complete with page searching, editing, and tagging features, using the technology stack we have been learning so far - Node.js, Express.js, Postgres, and now Sequelize, to interface with Postgres.
